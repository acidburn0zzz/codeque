## Overview 📣

CodeQue is structural code search tool for TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

CodeQue can be used to search for any code, from simple symbol search to complex multiline patterns.

It reduces struggle by providing accurate results regardless the formatting noise.

It makes it easy to get familiar with codebase and helps make better decisions as a result.

You can also use it as a linter.
