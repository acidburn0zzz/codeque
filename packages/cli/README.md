## Overview üì£

CodeQue is structural code search tool for TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

CodeQue can be used to search for any code, from simple symbol search to complex multiline patterns.

It reduces struggle by providing accurate results regardless the formatting noise.

It makes it easy to get familiar with codebase and helps make better decisions as a result.

You can use it also as a linter.

In first place it's code search, so you can use it to search any code (as long as it is TypeScript or JavaScript - more languages in future)

Here are some use cases where CodeQue shines

### Search duplicated code

### Search API usage
### Assertions 
(yarn test:restricted-code)

### Git hooks 
(my pre-commit hook)
