# CodeQue - Multiline Structural Search for Visual Studio Code

CodeQue is code search engine that understands the code syntax. 

It matches structure rather than plain text, which makes it very effective for complex queries.

VSCode extension aims to improve code search experience. 

Advanced search options and todo-like list of accurate search results makes it your new super power.

It's one of the tools in the ecosystem. There is also [CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codeque/cli) and ESLint plugin coming soon.

CodeQue supports JavaScript and TypeScript for now. 

More languages will be added once it will get traction.
